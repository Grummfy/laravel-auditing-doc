# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed; to keep things organized, all bugs and requests should be opened on github issues tab for the main project in the [owen-it/laravel-auditing/issues](https://github.com/owen-it/laravel-auditing/issues).

All pull requests should be made to the branch Develop, so they can be tested before being merged into the master branch.
